# 🌽 Corn Leaf Disease Prediction Model

This project is a **Deep Learning–based Corn Leaf Disease Prediction System** that classifies corn (maize) leaf images into different disease categories using a trained neural network model.  
The goal is to help farmers and researchers **detect plant diseases early** and improve crop yield.
